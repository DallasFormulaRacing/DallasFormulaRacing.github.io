As \"unfun\" as it can be to explain how your project works to an infant, it gives you ample insight into how you can make your project more usable for other developers on our team, while also enabling new members to start working with the code that you have written.</p> <p>Going into any documentation for DFR, you should have the mindset of needing to explain everything that you can in as much detail as possible. Even if that means explaining some very basic things that might not be valuable to you, this kind of documentation for new members who may know little to nothing about development, let alone CS as a whole, is incredibly useful. Now, this doesn't mean that you need to explain every single line of code that you write, and unlike many of the beginner-level CS and SE courses here at UTD, you will not be required to document specific statements within your code, primarily the highlights, so any functions, class definitions, and overarching project goals, should be explained in as much detail as possible, while also being as verbose as possible.</p> <p>What \"verbose\" means is partially up for interpretation as everyone has their own individual writing styles, however, at its core, being verbose means that you describe everything as \"simply\" as you can. \"Simply\" in this case not meaning low word count, it instead means in a method that is the easiest to understand. For example, if you were to describe to someone who has no clue what a Python <code>dictionary</code> object is by saying it's a \"way for you to use custom indexes for data storage under a single variable declaration,\" they would likely have no clue what that means. Instead, it would be better to describe a Python <code>dictionary</code> as \"a means of storing multiple data points under one variable declaration, where each data point has its own unique name, known as an index.\" In essence, don't describe your functions as if the end user knows what they do based on their name alone, ex. for a function you should describe what the function does as a whole initially, then describe each of the required arguments for that function, and what the expected values of those arguments are. It's also generally a good idea to include an example usage of your work, whether that's an entire file, or just a single line snippet included after each documented chunk, it's incredibly useful for someone just learning how to use your work.</p>"},{"location":"about/style-guide/#headings-and-titles","title":"Headings and titles","text":"<p>All section titles should use Title Case.
